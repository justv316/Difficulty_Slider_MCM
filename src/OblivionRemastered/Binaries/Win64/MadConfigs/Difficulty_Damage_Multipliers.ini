[DifficultyDamageMultiplier]
DefaultValue=5.0
Description=Oblivion Remastered 1.2 changed how Difficulty damage calculations are done. Instead of 1 setting, there are 12. This MCM's intention is to scale the difficulty multipliers based on a unified value like the old days. The individual damage settings are scaled appropriately based on this number.
